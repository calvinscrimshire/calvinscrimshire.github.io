    <p>I've been working in digital design and marketing for over 10 years. It's the field I love where I can constantly learn and tackle new and exciting projects for my clients.</p>
<p>I bring a deep knowledge of web design standards and technology that give my clients the "extra push" other marketers have trouble offering. Mix this with years of Google Ads and Facebook ads experience and we have a contender for your favorite new marketer. ;)</p>
<p>I've worked on both the client and freelancer side of projects for many years, so I understand the keys to successful projects. Such as great communication at the beginning, great communication in the middle, and great communication at the end of each partnership. All pain points I experienced as a client were related to communication, and I'll work all that harder towards great communication as your marketer.</p>
<p>Did I mention I love great communication?</p>
<p>I've helped local businesses earn $4 cost per lead on Google Adwords, even in a saturated marketplace with national brands bidding against us. (case study pending)</p>
<p>I've helped ecommerce companies earn a ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) of 6, distributing their marketing strategy across all the big ad marketplaces: Google Search, Google Display, Youtube, Facebook, Bing, and Pinterest. (case study pending)</p>
<p>I've helped a company in the consumer debt sector earn leads at $42 each in Google Search &amp; Display ads, even while high quality keywords were being being bid upon at $74 per click. (case study pending)</p>
<p>I've sought out diverse projects in many different business sectors in my pursuit to empower business owners. I can optimize poor performing websites to improve conversion rates. I can build your site from dead scratch carefully adhering to best practices and staying within the requirements of your over-arching marketing strategy. I can revamp your advertising on Google or Facebook to improve your cost per lead or sale. I can deliver a complete marketing strategy to help reach your key business goals.</p>
<p>The joy of working on digital marketing is helping people solve problems which helps them make them money. I think there's no higher calling in life than empowering others, and I'd love to learn how I can empower your business.</p>
<p>Let's talk!
-Calvin</p>
