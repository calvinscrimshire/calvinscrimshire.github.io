	One Fast Cat Kickstarter Launch v2

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Can an unknown pet brand turn a profit from a Kickstarter launch?</p>
<p>Yes if that company is willing to shed some preconceived bias about how
Kickstarter works.</p>
<p>In 2014 I put the question and hypothesis to the test with the One Fast Cat
Exercise Wheel. My boss had finished a 3 year product development life-cycle and
had a problem: How will we fund the tooling and first production run?</p>
<p>2014 was near the peak of the hype around the Kickstarter platform.  The Pebble
Watch had just happened, and there was this lingering thought that if you put
something on Kickstarter it could go viral spontaneously. The belief was that
Kickstarter's users were actively hunting for projects to commit money to.</p>
<p>For this launch I was responsible for all the media and advertising strategy. I
was also responsible for building and maintaining the Kickstarter page.</p>
<p>I researched the H-E-&#x1F3D2;-&#x1F3D2; out of other successful projects.  I
quickly discovered that each success story had a strong customer community that
was built outside of the Kickstarter platform.</p>
<h2>Bring Your Own Audience</h2>
<p><img alt="One Fast Cat Beat It's Goal On Kickstarter" src="/images/ofc-kickstarter-2.jpg"></p>
<p>We set up a web page apart for Kickstarter and drove visitors to a newsletter
subscription form.  We ran ads on Facebook and Google to our website.  We
reached out to as many people as possible in the high energy cat community and
they became our fervent supporters.</p>
<p>In the end we ran a marketing campaign, and Kickstarter was just the platform
where we collected sales.</p>
<p>We beat our $10,000 initial goal and earned $344,000 in 60 days.  We went viral
and family members were sending screenshots of my product on the CNN home page
news feed.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<hr>
<p>Yes a small unknown brand can make a successful market launch on Kickstarter,
and even fund an entire production run of the first product. It's not easy
though, and it's really all about connecting with your intended audience in a
real and authentic way. </p>
<p>It was right of me to be suspicious of the hype around Kickstarter in 2014. We
didn't gain traction on the platform until nearly our entire pre-built grass
roots audience had backed our product. All this marketing work we did
beforehand proved we were worthy of backer's hard earned dollars.</p>
