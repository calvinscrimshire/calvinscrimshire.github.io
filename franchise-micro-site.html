  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I believe that each page on a website is an opportunity to make a sale. However, many businesses don’t capitalize on that opportunity&mdash;leaving money on the table. </p>
<p>In 2018, one of my clients was a small glass &amp; window franchise in Indiana. The existing Google Ads campaign linked to a corporate site with a glut of PR content that was written to increase the credibility of the brand.</p>
<p>I discovered from sales data that most people called them called because they had broken auto glass&mdash;the bulk of which were windshields. However, the online process took three clicks just to get to the “request a quote” page. In my experience, customers easily become impatient. More clicks = fewer conversions. A conservative drop-off rate is 50% for each added click (and that’s generous).</p>
<p>To reduce the number of clicks, I created a new website with a single landing page. This page gave customers the ability to request a quote immediately. The micro site featured simple, straight forward copy that targeted relevant keywords that aligned with our Google Ads campaign. </p>
<p>Customers were able to type in their personal information, as well as their car’s make and model in a form that auto-completed for them. Per my client’s request, these forms were sent to the quote team via email, just how they normally were from the corporate site. I also tied in Mailchimp’s API to automatically stash leads as well as push out a trickle email sequence to the potential customers. </p>
<p>Because the client business was a franchise, there were severe limitations to what I was able to manipulate on the corporate website. After implementing the new landing page on a micro site, the conversion rate from CPC traffic went up to 9.6%. The cost per lead for Google Search and Display was just $4. Not to mention, brand value was increased and we were now able to generate monthly reports of incoming CPC leads thanks to the integration with MailChimp. </p>
